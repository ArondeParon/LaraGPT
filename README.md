# LaraGPT (because I can't think of a better name just yet)

This is a simple clone of the ChatGPT interface using the following tools:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)

# Getting started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Build the frontend assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

...and you should be good to go!
